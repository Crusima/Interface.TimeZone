# Interface.TimeZone

Module for showing the current time around the globe

## Usage

When this module is activated a clock will be added to the game.

When clicking on the clock you can easily switch between different time offsets on the globe. Currently implemented time offsets are:

UTC, PST, PDT and CET

If you need some other offset to be added let me now and I will update the module.
